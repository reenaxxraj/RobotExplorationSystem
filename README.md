# RobotExplorationSystem
Build a robotic system that can
- Autonomously explore + traverse an unknown area, avoiding obstacles
- Plan and follow fastest path from X to Y through a predefined way point.
- Transmit and receive control signals from mobile device
- Simulate physical robot and algorithms in software
- Detect the images displayed on the arena

A* Path finding algorithm is used for finding the fastest path. The exploration algorithm uses a left wall hugging algorithm. 

This source code contains only the simulator and the algorithm component of the robot navigation system. Please select "NO" when prompted "Is this a real run?" to run the system in a virtual simulation.
